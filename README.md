AQI, Air Quality Index measurements, were taken across Great Britain and Ireland from December 2020 to July 2021 as we slowly left lockdown during the Covid-19 pandemic.  AQI records were harvested from www.waqi.info (to later compare with indices relating to pollution and public health), gaining access via their webpage https://aqicn.org/api/.

One goal is to explore if it is worth paying for the air we breathe. Everyone buys the food and drink we consume, but not the air we breathe. I think the consequence of this is that there are lower standards for air. 

There are tie-ins to current ecological concerns.  For instance, 120 people died during the summer 2021 floods in Belgium & Germany, many along the Maas/ Meuse river.  Along the same river valley in 1930 a "fog incident" killed sixty people after inhaling industrial smog, but no air quality legislation was introduced until the creation of the EU.  In the UK, the Clean Air Acts of 1956 (four years after London's Great Smog), 1968 and 1993 were passed by parliament, but it still took a decade for the 2013 death of nine-year-old Ella Kissi-Debrah to be legally attributed to "air pollution exposure" in Lambeth.  In 2015 the Paris Agreement aims to limit global heating to 1.5Â°C and with a little foresight it is easy to imagine future generations astonished at our sluggish response.
