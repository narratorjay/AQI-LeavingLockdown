AQI, Air Quality Index measurements, were taken across Great Britain and Ireland from December 2020 to July 2021 as we slowly left lockdown during the Covid-19 pandemic.  AQI records were harvested from www.waqi.info to compare with indices relating to pollution and public health, gaining access via their webpage https://aqicn.org/api/.

The goal is to explore if it is worth paying for the air we breathe. Everyone buys the food they eat, what they drink, but not the air they breathe. I think the consequence of this is that there are high standards for food and drink but air is polluted to a far worse extent. 

There are tie-ins to current ecological concerns.  For instance, 120 people died during the summer 2021 floods in Belgium & Germany, many along the Maas/ Meuse river.  In the 1930 "fog incident" along the same river valley 60 people died after inhaling industrial smog.  No air quality legislation was introduced - until the creation of the EU.  In the UK, the Clean Air Acts of 1956 (four years after London's Great Smog), 1956 and 1993 were passed, but it took almost a decade for the 2013 death of nine-year-old Ella Kissi-Debrah to be legally attributed to "air pollution exposure" in Lambeth.
